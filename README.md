This repository contains my mini project for Assignment 04 of the course ETCCCP105 (Computer Science Fundamentals & Career Pathways).  
The project is a simple portfolio website created using HTML and CSS.  
The focus of this assignment was to understand development tools like VS Code, Git, and GitHub.

## Project Files
- index.html — main structure of the webpage
- style.css — styling of the webpage
- MY PHOTO.jpg — personal image displayed on website

## Features
- Clean and minimal layout
- HTML and CSS separated for better structure
- Fully functional in any browser
- Organised folder structure

## Development Tools Used
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git (version control)
- GitHub (repository hosting)

## Git Commands Used
•	git init                         (Initializes a Git repository)
•	git add .                        (Stages all project files)
•	git commit -m "Initial commit"   (Records the first snapshot of the project)
•	git branch -M main               (Ensures the main branch is named 'main')
